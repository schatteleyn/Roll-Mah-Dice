I needed a dice for my role play game, but I couldn't find one, so I coded this. Also, it's a good way to learn JS.
You can choose the type of the dice (D6, D20 ...) and the number of roll you wanna make.

TO DO:
- OOP
- Other awesome features ?

IN PROGRESS:
- Choosing number of dices to use

"Homepage link" is the code on JSbin.com in OOP.
